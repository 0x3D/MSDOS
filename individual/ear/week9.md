# Individual Reflection for week 9
Reflection from Erik Anttila Ryderup on week 9.

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
Last week I wanted to learn how to package the apps. I accomplished this which
means that the group now has a jar file for the backend app and a serveable
package of the frontend application. The goal to learn how to structure the code
was not something I were able to accomplish because of the amount of changes
that I would have to do. I didn't want to break the App when we are supposed to
present it next monday. Another thing is how much value the customer will get
from a better code structure when everything already works? I guess it would be
really important if the code went into production where another team would take
over the responsibility. But if the program doesn't need to be extended? 

The goal about how to structure documentation where answered in this weeks
lecture so I will comply to that. 

During the project we had a lot of problems with testing the project. This is
something I would like to avoid. Another thing I would like to be better with my
documentation so I have a better process. Sometimes I don't even write the
documentation the same day. 

To avoid problems with testing I will try test-driven development which may
solve the problems by making sure the tests are there from the start. To get
better with the documentation part I will try to think about while coding and
not after the coding is done. 


## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Last week I said I would help with obstacles which I did. I took care of the
build with travis so the rest of the team could code without thinking about
continous integration. I helped my team with the use of Swedish and grammar
while writing by proofreading and editing their text. I were active in our
communication channels. And I reminded the team about that I were available to
help. 

Next week the focus will change from programming to writing a good final
report. This means that I will be more active with proofreading and editing than
earlier. I will also make sure that the team understands and knows how the code
works. In future projects I will try to make it clearer that I am able to help
them with problems that they encounter. I want to make sure that everyone knows.
This because it will be better as a team to work together and it is really
important. 


## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I had the scrum meetings and made sure that our Trello were updated. 

Next week I would like to have a sprint meeting, a sprint review meeting
and then a project review meeting where I will ask the team what they thought
about the entire project. So that we can reflect with a product that is done. I
think this will help everyone in the team think about their own roles and how
they can be a better team member in the next project.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week I wrote a lot on the final report, made several fixes to the code,
fixed the build system. And streamlined how to get the backend started. The team 
wrote the team reflection together. 

Next week I am going to write a lot in the final report so we can deliver on
time.
