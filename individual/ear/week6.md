# Individual Reflection for week 6
Reflection from Erik Anttila Ryderup on week 6.

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to understand sprint planning and sprint review better. What should be
discussed and so on. Coding wise I want to be able to help better. Learn how I
can better get my share of work. To get better at sprint planning and sprint
reviews. To get better at this  I will try to find information on the internet
of what are common points to cover at these meetings. To get a better share of
work I will make sure take up the question at sprint planning. 

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I have to make myself available to answer questions. This week I monitored our
slack channel and responded to questions directly. 


## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I lead the sprint planning and sprintreview meeting. I also made sure that the
trelloboard worked well. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I helped with the team reflection, we wrote it together. I also wrote some code
for the project.
