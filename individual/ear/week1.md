# Individual Reflection for week 1.
Reflection from Erik Anttila Ryderup on week 1. 

## What do I want to learn or understand better?  
Currently I don't really understand scrum. I get that you should break up the
tasks into smaller chunks and then do each of them for a short duration. But I
want to learn how scrum works and why you use it. I would like to know how do we
implement Scrum so it works for us?  To make this happen I will listen to the
lectures and read in "Scrum and XP from the Trenches". To make it work for us I
will need to ask the group what they feel are working and think about what I
think is working. 


## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Right now I don't know what the others in my team know. I would like that
everyone in my team contributes their strengths to the entire team. To help
reach this goal I will ask everyone about their experience with social contracts
and explain what I have learned about social contracts. I think that it will be
a learning experience for the entire team to talk about their own experiences
with social contracts.

The students from _I_ didn't really know a lot about git and had to create accounts 
on github. It is important that everyone feels like git is at least useable. To 
help the other students become better on git I will ask if they need help and be
available if git makes something unexpected. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?  
We have not really started with Scrum yet. By next week I would like that we at
least start thinking about Scrum and how it can be implemented. To reach this
goal I will communicate with my team about what they think Scrum is and how we
can use it to have a better process. 


## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?  
I already have experience from an earlier course with Social Contracts. So this
week I prepared talking points that I know from earlier is important aspects to
talk about. Then as a team we will discuss the points and hopefully reach a
contract that the entire team feel is mostly good.
