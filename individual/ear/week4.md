# Individual Reflection for week 4
Reflection from Erik Anttila Ryderup on week 4.

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I had a bit of knowledge of react starting out but my goal for the week was to
know enough to be able to produce useful code. To reach this goal I read through
code examples and concepts on reacts docs. 

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
As mentioned eariler weeks not everyone is used to git. This week I guided some
teammembers through the use of git, this turned out to show a lot more than
intended because git had problems. I think it was a good introduction to see the
hard things so that the `pull, branch, commit, branch, pull, merge push`
workflow seems easy in comparision!  

Since I have read a lot about Javascript and especially about ReactJS I tried
helping the team with the concepts I had learned.  

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?  
I was the scrum master this week So I made sure that the team had scrum planning
and scrum review. This week it was a bit hard to guide the team
on the meetings. Next week I want to become better at this task. To accomplish
this the team had input on this weeks scrum review. 

I pushed this week to use the userstories and trello which the team made happen.   

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?  
This week we had the first team reflection, I tried understandning what was
needed of the team and then explain to the others. I also wrote a lot on the
document but the entire team was innvolved in writing the document.  

I had problems using react. This week I asked a lot of questions to the guys in
my team that had gotten work done. I was present for the joint progamming on
Zoom.  

I set up TravisCI continous integration which hopefully should help us in the
future.
