# Individual Reflection for week 5
Reflection from Erik Anttila Ryderup on week 5.

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to expand on my knowledge of react from last week to be more useful to
the team and write more code. This week I tried to expand this knowledge by
pairprogramming asking why my teammates did things in some ways and test myself. 

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
This week I pairprogrammed a lot with Erik. I think he learned a lot from it, I
did at least. 

I showed the team how to do code reviews with Github's pull request which was
new for them. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I was the scrum master again so I had the scrum planning and scrum
retrospective/review meetings. This week I tried to get a lot of information on
how they thought the process should be changed. I didn't get a lot of feedback. 

As last week I looked at our scrumboard and tried to keep it tidy. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week we had to do the Team Reflection and finish the sprint. I focused on
finishing the sprint. I coded a lot on the login system for the web page.
