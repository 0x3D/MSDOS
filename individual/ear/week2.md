# Individual Reflection for week 2
Reflection from Erik Anttila Ryderup on week 2.

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
From last week I wanted to learn Scrum. I didn't feel that I had a very good
grip on it after week 1. So this week I again focused my attention on Scrum.
Fortunately Jan-Philipp had a very good exercise that awoke questions about
scrum for me he then followed it up with a lecture that cleared up a lot. I will
keep reading in "Scrum and XP from the Trenches".  

In our team we have had discussions about using HTML+CSS+Javascript (ReactJS) to
write our project as a web app. I have almost no knowledge about how web apps
work. This I would like to fix before starting coding so that I can be
productive immediatly. To achieve a basic understanding on how reactJS works I
will look through [ReactJS's docs.](https://reactjs.org/docs)

We had an exercise in splitting user stories into several small user stories. I
would like to be able to do this. Currently I couldn't, on the 10 minutes given
to me I couldn't split it further than the 3 we did. This was because the
original userstories we did was to broad and covered too much of the task. To
fix this and get better with user stories I will do the exercise myself and be
able to take my time. I think it is beneficial for me to redo it to be able to
slice them. 

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
The entire team had difficulity understanding what Business Model Canvas is.
Since we had a deliverable this week which included a Business Model Canvas it
was well past time to get an understanding. Our team had a very constructive
discussion about this. It helped my understanding a lot and I think it helped
the others too. 

The problems with git from last week is still present. But the other teammembers
seemed open to get help with git so I believe it will be resolved quickly once
we start coding. I will do my best to give them help with git. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?  
We had a trello board from week 1 but it was only filled with links. We wanted
to have the board ready to go so that we can fill it up with user stories and
tasks. I added a few lists I thought were important and necessary and I provided
feedback to my teammate that set it up. 

Other than this we have not really started with Scrum yet. The ambition is to
start using scrum next week when we start doing user stories. We had an exercise
on monday where the entire team got a taste of Scrum. I think to be able to use
scrum next week doing the exercises was a good way to get started. I feel like
we have to discuss rules for how to moving of tasks and stories happens. 


## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?  
We started without a plan for the design and look of our project. To get a
preliminary design in place and a mockup I made sure to be active in designing
the application and lifting questions about the design. To help get a design
that works well I refreshed my memory of design patterns and applied them to the
GUI.

No one in our group really knew how the Business Model Canvas should look. To be
able to deliver I looked up what a Business Model Canvas is. For this I used
[wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas) I think that
this made a positive impact on the groups ability to deliver. We wrote the text
collaborative as a group so I hope that my inputs and comments helped the team.
