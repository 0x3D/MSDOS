# Individual Reflection for week 7
Reflection from Erik Anttila Ryderup on week 7.

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
Last week I wanted to understand the sprint planning and sprint review better. I
made some progress this week, the group had an agenda we followed that I found
on the [internet](https://startinfinity.com/product-management-framework/scrum-sprint/sprint-review-vs-sprint-retrospective).
 I feel like this site explained sprint review to me. Last week I also wanted to
 get better at coding in react, I feel like I am slowly starting to 'get it'. I
 had a much better grasp this week than last week. At the beginning of the
 course I read a lot but I feel like writing my own code and seeing code in
 code reviews worked much better for me. The group also commited to be better at
 dividing the work between the team members. 

 Next week I would like to learn how a RESTful service and how a backend works.
 Because our project badly needs one to handle passwords in a better way. This
 is because right now everything happens on the client which is not secure at
 all. I looked into this a few weeks ago and it is not secure doing in client.
 Also now the settings are saved in the client too. This means to change allowed
 amount of bookings the user just have to inspect website with chrome! To learn
 this I will use google. I will start looking at the tool _Spring_ for Java and
 _Flask_ for python. I have seen them mentioned earlier when searching.

 I would also like to learn about how to structure code in react in a better way
 because right now I feel like the codebase is a bit messy. To learn this I will
 take a look at open source websites. I think I can find them on github. I know
 at least one is available on react docs. 

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Last week I made a pledge to make myself available. I continued with this it is
really easy to have slack open and get a notice when someone needs help. I also
help everyone with git. I helped Erik with coding the Rebooking function, more
specifically how to send a function to make his code work. This was new for him
and I am happy that he learned it. 

Next week I would like to continue helping the team with coding related
questions and git. To make this happen I will stay in the slack channel and see
if someone needs help. I will also make an advertisement on next weeks sprint
planning that I am avaiable in the slack chat so everyone knows. 
## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I am the scrummaster so I make sure that the team has a sprint planning meeting,
that the board is used, that all cards are in the right place and that the team
has a sprint retrospective/review. This is the same as last week. 

Next weeek I will make sure that the team knows that I can help them with
clearing obstacles so that they can focus on coding.
I will also take a look at the environment, is it productive? Are there outside
interruptions or distractions that I can help with? 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I wrote a lot of code for the project, I fixed some tests with travis. I also
made restrictions for amount of bookings work. I wrote some jsdocs for a couple
of files. And I made a lot of small fixes here and there. 

As usual I also helped the team with reflection and wrote it down together with
them. This week I and Erik Bengtsson wrote a lot of documentation in the system
design document. 

Next week I would like to get the System Design Document into a even better
state than it currently is in. I also want to finish a lot of the userstories
that is in the backlog.
