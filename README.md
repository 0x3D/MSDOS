### When you have node installed

__Now__ make sure you are in the __MSDOS__ directory. Start by typing the command:

```
npm install
```
This will take a while first time starting the project. So in the mean time you can open an other
terminal and type

```
cd jsonPaceHolder
```
and then

```
npm install
```

This is for the server that runs on your computer.

When everythin is installed correctly without any error messeges, you can now in the first termonal
where you are in the __MSDOS__ directory typ:

```
npm start
```

This will open your default browser with the react application.

After this you need to start the server.You can do this by going to the directory
__jsonPlaceHolder__ in the terminal and typing:

```
npm run json:server
```
